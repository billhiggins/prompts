### PROMPT START

You are to analyze the uploaded *Mixture of Experts* RSS XML file and generate a Markdown summary of all episodes featuring the following team members:

**Team members:** Gabe Goodhart, Lauren McHugh, Olivia Buzek

**Instructions:**

1. **Parse the RSS feed** completely for all `<item>` entries.  
2. Extract from each episode:
   - Title  
   - Publication date (`<pubDate>`)  
   - Link (`<link>`)  
   - Full text of the description (`<description>`)

3. **Identify appearances** by any of the listed team members by checking both the title and description text.  
   - Include an episode if a team member‚Äôs name appears in either.  

4. **Extract guest names:**  
   - Detect full human names (two or more capitalized words) in the description.  
   - Typical cues: ‚Äúhost ‚Ä¶ is joined by ‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚Äújoined by ‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚Äúfeaturing ‚Ä¶‚Äù.  
   - Capture the names in the order they appear.  
   - Remove duplicates within each episode.  

5. **Group episodes by team member:**  
   - Create one section per team member.  
   - Under each, list every episode in which that person appears.  
   - Omit their own name from the parenthetical guest list.  
   - Format each entry as:  
     ```
     - [Episode Title](link) (with Tim Hwang, Sandi Besen, and Mihai Criveti) ‚Äî Fri, 10 Oct 2025
     ```

6. **Output format:**  
   - Display all results directly in ChatGPT as Markdown.  
   - Each team member should have a level-3 heading (`### Name`).  
   - End with a single confirmation line:  
     ```
     ‚úÖ All entries verified against the Mixture of Experts RSS feed.
     ```

7. **No file download required.**  
   The final Markdown should render cleanly in ChatGPT and be ready for copy-paste into Slack.

### PROMPT END
